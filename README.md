**Ultimate Goalie** uses the keyboard arrows to allow the player to move around a goalie avatar.
As soccer balls come hurtling towards the goal from the top of the screen, the player must move around to block the ball from entering the goal.  The player cannot enter the restricted goal area, this makes the game more challenging. The balls spawn at random positions on the x-axis and depending on their location, they either launch straight or curve toward the center of the screen.  When the player collides with a ball, the ball bounces away, and the player gets a point. If the player fails to block a ball, 
they lose one of 3 lives. Some balls miss the goal (similar to a real soccer game) and these stray balls dont cause the score or live count to change.
The game displays the players score with text and remaining lives using a heart icon. Once all the lives are lost, the game is over. The player is shown their final score and prompted to play again.
